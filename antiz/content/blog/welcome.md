As stated in the [home page](https://antiz.fr), this website serves as a central place to get general/contact info about me. It also contains a list to all my social media.  
  
If you want to contact me, reach me at `robincandau@protonmail.com`, `@Antiz96` on Twitter or `Antiz#4953` on Discord.  
  
I'll use this blog section to publish some blog posts when I feel like it. They will *most likely* be about Linux related topics (regarding my day job and the various Open Source projects I contribute to).  
  
Once again, welcome! :smile:  

This is a test
