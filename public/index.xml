        <description><p>Fellow Arch Linux mate <a href="https://github.com/kpcyrd">kpcyrd</a> recently published a <a href="https://vulns.xyz/2024/12/2024-wrapped/">&ldquo;2024 recap&rdquo; blog post</a> which (in addition of being a really cool, interesting and impressive read) inspired me to write my own.</p>
<p>So here is a recap of all the noticeable FOSS related stuff I had the chance to work on &amp; achieve in 2024. &#x1f604;</p></description>

      <title>Maintaining and building Alpine packages from Arch Linux</title>

        <description><h2 id="alpine-packaging-tooling-are-now-available-in-the-arch-linux-extra-repository">Alpine packaging tooling are now available in the Arch Linux [extra] repository!</h2>
<p>I recently added the <a href="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/abuild">abuild</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/Leo/atools">atools</a> Alpine packaging tooling to the Arch Linux [extra] repository.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, these tools can now be used to maintain and build Alpine packages (in a clean chroot) from an Arch Linux system, without requiring to rely on a separate Alpine installation, such as a container or a VM.<br>
By enabling the Alpine packaging workflow directly from an Arch Linux system, this streamlines the process of maintaining Alpine packages for Arch users that <em>also</em> contribute to Alpine Linux (like I do).</p></description>

      <title>What should we learn from the XZ situation as Package Maintainers?</title>

        <description><h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>As you probably already know by now, a backdoor / security vulnerability has been <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">recently discovered in xz</a>. In this article, I wonâ€™t cover the technical aspect or the potential consequences of it (it has already been done by people way more knowledgeable than am I on that matter) but I will expose what I think we should learn from it, from a packaging stand point.</p></description>

      <title>Automatically power back on servers after a power outage with a Raspberry Pi and Wake On Lan</title>
      <link>https://antiz.fr/blog/raspberry-pi-wake-on-lan-server/</link>

        <description><h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I recently woke up with a non-working network connection in my house, both internet and LAN accesses were down.<br>
I immediately checked on my internet provider, but my router seemed running just fine and no breakages were reported on their side in my region.</p>
<p>I then decided to check on my own infrastructure and realised that both of my physical servers were down. Those servers host my DNS and DHCP services, which explains why I had a faulty network connection.<br>
After a quick thought, I understood that a power outage occurred during the night (which wasn&rsquo;t so obvious at first as the power was back when I woke up), causing my servers to go down. While my router automatically switched back on when the power came back, my servers didn&rsquo;t. Indeed, <em>without extra configuration,</em> you physically need to press down the power button to power them on.</p></description>
