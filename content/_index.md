# Hey! :wave:

My name is Robin Candau (also known as Antiz).  
I'm a french Linux system & DevOps engineer passionate about skateboarding, music, cycling and, obviously, Linux!

This website serves as a central place to share general information about me and my work, as well as publishing some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.

## Projects

As an open source enthusiast, I contribute to many open source projects and I’m always willing to help, share and learn in the process!  
The main projects I actively contribute to are:

### Arch Linux

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that focuses on simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality and versatility.

- Package Maintainer: As part of the [Arch Linux Package Maintainers](https://archlinux.org/people/package-maintainers/#Antiz), I contribute to the development of the distribution by maintaining [packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=Antiz) in Arch's official repositories.

- DevOps: As part of the DevOps team, I contribute to the maintenance of the [Arch Linux infrastructure](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/infrastructure).

- WSL image maintainer: I maintain the [official Arch Linux WSL image](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archlinux-wsl).

- Testing team member and coordinator: As a [testing team](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Testing_Team) member, I test & verify packages submitted to the Arch Linux testing repositories before they get promoted to the stable ones. I’m also in charge of on-boarding new testing team members.

- AUR Package maintainer and moderator: In addition of maintaining packages in the official repositories, I'm also maintaining [some packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&SeB=M&K=Antiz&outdated=&SB=p&SO=d&PP=50&submit=Go) in the AUR (a [community-driven repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) maintained by Arch users) and I participate to its moderation.

- Various other contributions: I’m also contributing to numerous other parts of the Arch Linux project as whole, such as some of our tools (e.g. [pacman-contrib](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman-contrib), [devtools / pkgctl](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/devtools), [archlinux-contrib](https://github.com/archlinux/contrib)), [reproducible builds](https://reproducible.archlinux.org/), [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org), [submitting RFCs](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/rfcs), interacting with the community...

### Reproducible Builds

[Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code.

- Contributor: I regularly submit upstream and downstream patches in regards to Reproducible Builds, some of them being covered in `reproducible-builds.org`'s [monthly news](https://reproducible-builds.org/news/).

### Alpine Linux

[Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org) is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

- Packaging: I maintain [some packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=Robin+Candau) in Alpine Linux repositories and I'm contributing at raising & fixing some packaging issues. I am also maintaining [some of Alpine's packaging tooling](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=alpine&maintainer=Antiz&flagged=) in Arch Linux repositories.

### Arch-Update

[Arch-Update](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update) is an update notifier & applier for Arch Linux that assists you with important pre / post update tasks.

- Developer / Maintainer: Arch-Update is one of the Open Source projects I develop and maintain over on [GitHub](https://github.com/Antiz96).
