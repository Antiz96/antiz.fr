# Hey!

My name is Robin Candau.  
I'm a french Linux system & DevOps engineer passionate by skate, music, (craft) beer and, obviously, Linux!

This website serves as a central place to get general & contact info about me, as well as writing some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.

## Projects

I contribute to many open source projects and I'm always willing to help, share and learn in the process!  
Here are the main projects I actively contribute to:

### Arch Linux

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that focuses on simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality and versatility.

- Package Maintainer: As [part of the Arch Linux staff](https://archlinux.org/people/package-maintainers/#Antiz), I contribute to the development of the distribution by maintaining [packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=Antiz) in Arch's official repositories.

- Testing Team member and coordinator: My role within the Arch Linux [Testing team](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Testing_Team) is to install, test and verify that the packages submitted to the Arch's "testing" repositories are working as intended and do not include any regressions nor bugs in order to validate (or not) their "promotion" to the official stable repositories (done collaboratively with the other members of the Arch Linux Testing team). I'm also one of the persons in charge of creating and managing testing team members' accounts.

- AUR Package maintainer and moderator: In addition of maintaining packages in the official repositories (as part of my Package Maintainer role), I'm maintaining [packages in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&SeB=M&K=Antiz&outdated=&SB=p&SO=d&PP=50&submit=Go) (a [community-driven repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) maintained by Arch users). I also participate to the AUR moderation.

- Various other contributions: I'm also contributing to numerous other parts of the Arch Linux project as whole (e.g. [pacman-contrib](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman-contrib), [devtools / pkgctl](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/devtools), [archlinux-contrib](https://github.com/archlinux/contrib), [infrastructure stuff](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/infrastructure), [submitting RFCs](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/rfcs), etc...), I'm interacting with the community via the different communication channels ([IRC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_IRC_channels), [mailing lists](https://lists.archlinux.org/mailman3/lists/), etc...) and I'm making yearly financial donations (to the Arch project itself and/or to individuals actively contributing to it).

### Alpine Linux

[Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org) is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

- Packaging: I maintain [some packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=Robin+Candau) in Alpine's official testing repository and I'm opening (GitLab) issues & merge requests to fix some packaging issues.

### Arch-Update

[Arch-Update](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update) is an update notifier/applier for Arch Linux that assists you with important pre/post update tasks.

It has various features such as a clickeable systay applet & an automated check for update, and is designed to follow usual system maintenance steps, as described in the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance):  
It offers to read latest Arch news before updating the system, offers to remove orphan & old cached packages, to process pacnew files, to restart services that need a post upgrade restart, it checks for pending kernel updates requiring a reboot to be applied, etc... It optionally supports AUR & Flatpak packages as well as desktop notifications.

- Developer/Maintainer: Arch-Update is one of the Open Source projects I develop and maintain over on [GitHub](https://github.com/Antiz96).
