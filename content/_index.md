# Hey

My name is Robin Candau.  
I'm a french Linux system & DevOps engineer passionate by skate, music, (craft) beer and, obviously, Linux!

This website serves as a central place to get general/contact info about me, as well as writing some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.

## Projects

I contribute to many open source projects and I'm always willing to help, share and learn in the process!  
Here are the main projects I actively contribute to:

- Package Maintainer: As [part of the Arch Linux staff](https://archlinux.org/people/package-maintainers/#Antiz), I contribute to the development of the distribution by [maintaining packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=Antiz&flagged=) on Arch's official repositories as well as contributing to the AUR (Arch User Repository) moderation. Click [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Package_Maintainers) for more information.
- Testing Team member: My role within the Arch Linux Testing team is to install, test and verify that the packages submitted to the Arch's "testing" repositories are working as intended and without regressions nor bugs in order to validate (or not) their "promotion" to the official stable repositories (done collaboratively with the other members of the Arch Linux Testing team). Click [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Testing_Team) for more information.
- AUR Package maintainer: In addition of maintaining packages in the official repositories (as part of my Package Maintainer role), I also [submit and maintain packages on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&SeB=M&K=Antiz&outdated=&SB=p&SO=d&PP=50&submit=Go) which is a community repository maintained by Arch users. Click [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) for more information.
